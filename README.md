## Data

+ We will be working with the Palmer Penguins data set and the banknote authentication data set from UC Irvine ML Data Repository
+ Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

## Problem Statements

1. Researchers have asked for assistance in finding a way to predict a species of penguins on the field based on key physical attributes

2. Is there way a to way to predict real vs. fake bills by scanning and analyzing their wavelet transformation?
